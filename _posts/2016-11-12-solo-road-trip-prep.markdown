The thrill of the open road, being in control of your destiny. Everytime I fly, I long for the freedom and excitement that driving provides. Right now I’m preparing, both mentally and organizationally, for a solo road trip to Colorado. I’ve always loved road trips, and the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday gives me both the opportunity, and the time off work. This will be my first solo road trip since I moved myself out west five or six years ago. While it truely was an unforgettable and rewarding experience, the mixture of pure freedom, and complete self-reliance. At times it can be daunting and intimidating, which I imagine is why you feel so good when it’s all over with. So naturally, I have some butterflies about doing again. This week I’m preparing my car and my gear for the adventure. Stay tuned for more from the road next week.
