This is my very first blog post using Jekyll! ðŸŽ‰ I migrated this blog from Tumblr, which I created years and years ago.Â Jekyll seems pretty neat, and I'm excited to design my theme and find some cool plugins. And maybe automate a bit more of the process of posting :)

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
