Hi! I'm Brian. By day I'm a full-stack web developer, who specializes in video streaming, by night I'm a hobbyist in computers, electronics, 3d printing, woodworking, camping, overlanding, and a bunch of other stuff.

I decided to start a blog as a way of better documenting things for myself. Nothing is worse then debugging something and realizing the tutorial you're following seems very familiar. You realize you've totally had this problem before, but can't quite remember how you fixed it the last time. This blog is attempt to help my future self, and maybe some others too!
